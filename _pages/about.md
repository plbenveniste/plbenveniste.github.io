Hello!
After graduating with an MSc in Industrial Engineering applied to Energy, Transport and Environment at [ISAE-SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/fr/) in 2021 as well as an Msc in Management at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), I worked for a year and a half as a Data Analyst at [Onepoint](https://www.groupeonepoint.com/fr/). This experience led me to decide to change my career towards a career in research in Artificial Intelligence applied to health and biomedical imaging. 

In 2022-2023, I studied the [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/) (Mathematics, Vision, and Learning) Master at Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris, a master in Artificial Intelligence with a particular focus on Applied Mathematics. I am currently doing a PhD at [NeuroPoly](http://neuro.polymtl.ca/README.html) in [Polytechnique Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca/) focusing on Deep Learning methods for Medical Imaging. 

As a PhD student at Polytechnique Montréal, I am working on the automatic detection and segmentation of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesions in the spinal cord in MRI images. I am particularly interested in model generalizability, interpretability, causality, and shape analysis.
