Hello!
After graduating with an MSc in Industrial Engineering applied to Energy, Transport and Environment at [ISAE-SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/fr/) in 2021 as well as an Msc in Management at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), I worked for a year and a half as a Data Analyst at [Onepoint](https://www.groupeonepoint.com/fr/). This experience led me to decide to change my career towards a career in research in Artificial Intelligence applied to health and biomedical imaging. 

In 2022-2023, I studied the [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/) (Mathematics, Vision, and Learning) Master at Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris, a master in Artificial Intelligence with a particular focus on Applied Mathematics. I am currently doing a PhD at [NeuroPoly](http://neuro.polymtl.ca/README.html) at [Polytechnique Montréal](https://www.polymtl.ca/) focusing on building a foundational model for 3D medical images based on Implicit Neural Representations.

I am interested in research in Artificial Intelligence applied to biomedical imaging, drug discovery and biostatistics. As a research assistant, I would like to work at the interface between medical research and artificial intelligence. Working on new deep learning models such as multimodal models, foundation learning and other deep learning models would allow me to further explore the potential of AI tools to improve medical treatments. 

Amongst other topics, I am interested in biomedical imaging, cancer research, brain signal analysis, immunology, human vision, drug discovery, shape analysis and much more. I am also open to exploring other fields of research in health.
