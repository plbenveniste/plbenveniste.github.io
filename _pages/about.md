Hello !
After graduating a Master of Science Industrial Engineering applied to Energy, Transport and Environment at [ISAE-SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/fr/) in 2021 as well as a Master of Science in Management at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), I worked for a year and a half as a Data Analyst at [Onepoint](https://www.groupeonepoint.com/fr/). This experience lead me to decide to change a career towards a career in research in Artificial Intelligence applied to health and biomedical imaging. 

I am currently studying the MVA (Mathematics, Vision and Learning) master at Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure in Paris a master in Artificial Intelligence wiht a particular focus on Applied Mathematics.
