Hello !
After graduating a MSc in Industrial Engineering applied to Energy, Transport and Environment at [ISAE-SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/fr/) in 2021 as well as a Msc in Management at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), I worked for a year and a half as a Data Analyst at [Onepoint](https://www.groupeonepoint.com/fr/). This experience lead me to decide to change a career towards a career in research in Artificial Intelligence applied to health and biomedical imaging. 

I am currently studying the [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/) (Mathematics, Vision and Learning) Master at Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure in Paris, a master in Artificial Intelligence with a particular focus on Applied Mathematics. I am currently looking for a 6 months research internship in Artificial Intelligence applied to health, starting in April. 

I am interested in research in Artificial Intelligence applied to biomedical imaging, drug discovery and biostatistics. As a research assistant I would like to work at the interface between medical research and artificial intelligence. Working on new deep learning models such as multimodal models, foundation learning and other deep learning models would allow me to further explore the potential of AI tools to improve medical treatments. 

Amongst other topics, I am interested in biomedical imaging, cancer research, brain signal analysis, immunology, human vision, drug discovery, shape analysis and much more. I am also open to exploring other fields of research in health.
